	<h1>Shadow</h1>
	<p>A simple PHP file manager for uploading / sharing content and images.</p>
</div>

## About
I wasn't happy with any self-hosted file manager / file sharing solution out there, so I created my own. Shadow is intended for image sharing and embedding on various social platforms, but will work with any file format.

### Features:
- Supports any file format
- Beautiful & easy-to-navigate interface
- Image/video files embed in Twitter, Discord, Telegram and other socials
- User & file managment with customizable permissions
- Privacy settings for uploads
- Fully featured API
- More to come as I work on this project over the next few months

## Installation and Config
- The [&nearr;&nbsp;Shadow&nbsp;wiki](https://github.com/kiosion/shadow/wiki) has a quick-start guide, as well as detailed instructions for installation and configuration.
- Sample .HTACCESS and .ENV files can be found within the project's code, although the installer should properly configure these on its own.

Install instructions & an first-run install script are currently a work in progress.

## Requirements and dependencies

## Contributing
Shadow is still very much a work-in-progress, so feel free to contribute if you're knowledgeable with PHP, JS, SQL, or creating similar solutions.
