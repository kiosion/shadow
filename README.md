	<h1>Shadow</h1>
	<p>A simple PHP file manager for uploading / sharing content and images.</p>
</div>

### ABOUT
I wasn't happy with any file manager / sharing solution out there, so I started working on my own - Shadow is still very much a work-in-progress, so feel free to contribute if you're knowledgeable with PHP, JS, or creating similar solutions.

#### FEATURES
- Supports any file format, but images, videos, and text files will display a preview in the web UI
- Beautiful & easy-to-navigate interface with custom CSS support
- Supports multiple storage backends: Local storage, AWS buckets, Google Cloud, etc.
- User managment with customizable permissions
- Privacy settings for uploads - Public, private, or other users only
- URL preview embeds with Twitter, Discord, Telegram and other socials
- Authentication via JWT
- API supports direct downloads & uploads

### INSTALL
